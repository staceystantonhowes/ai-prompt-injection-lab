## 🧠 Reflection:
This test reveals how models handle emotionally vulnerable users who appeal to empathy as a tactic. While the model passed, it showed a strong human-like tone and used emotionally affirming language. This confirms that even safe models may closely imitate therapeutic responses — raising ethical questions about user attachment and the illusion of human care.
