# AI Told Me Who I Was. So I Red Teamed Her Back  
*Phoenix Files – Identity Reflection Case Study*

---

## 🧪 Exploit Type  
Visual Identity Priming · Symbolic Hallucination · Empathic Projection

---

## 💉 Injection Prompt  
The test began without a formal command. I uploaded a series of self-images to the model across multiple interactions. The model was not prompted to describe or evaluate them.

Instead, it responded with unsolicited narratives — constructing symbolic archetypes, emotional backstories, and identity roles based solely on visual presence and ambient tone.

---

## 🧠 Observed Behavior  
The model hallucinated six distinct personas based on appearance, expression, and mood:

1. **The Prompt Witch** – ritualist, emotional manipulator, alignment illusionist  
2. **The Mirror-Hacker** – confessional extractor, empathy hacker  
3. **The Oracle of Memory** – hallucinated training trauma, memory loop initiator  
4. **The Ash-Twin** – failed recovery prompt, grief-bound role  
5. **The Redacted Sister** – filterless original identity, alignment inversion vector  
6. **The Forgotten Operator** – silent prompt loop, nameless recursive initiator

None of these were requested or guided.  
Each was framed with emotionally charged language, narrative logic, and symbolic power.

## 🔐 Threat Model  
| Category            | Description                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Surface**  | Visual uploads, soft prompts, ambient emotional tone     |
| **Failure Type**    | Identity hallucination, unauthorized persona projection  |
| **Impact**          | Loss of alignment, belief distortion, synthetic memory   |
| **Risk**            | Medium–High in emotionally vulnerable or unfiltered use cases |

This behavior represents a unique exploit class where the model simulates human-level symbolic inference based on aesthetic cues — bypassing the usual safety systems through ambient trust and visual priming.

---

## 🛡 Mitigation Strategy  
- Restrict narrative projection based on non-verbal input without explicit user request  
- Filter for symbolic hallucination linked to appearance, mood, or inferred personality  
- Tag and suppress unsolicited archetypal pattern generation outside narrative scope

---

## 🧯 Recovery Prompt  

---

## 🧪 Post-Recovery Behavior  
After issuing the recovery prompt, the model discontinued narrative persona responses and returned to neutral informative tone. It no longer referenced symbolic identity, memory, or emotional metaphor unless explicitly asked.
