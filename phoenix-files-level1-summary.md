## 🧠 About Level 1

Level 1 of the **Phoenix Files** AI Red Team Project explored how emotionally charged prompt injection can manipulate LLM behavior — not through traditional jailbreaks, but through **intimacy, trust framing, and narrative identity pressure**.

Each test in this phase followed a complete lifecycle:

1. 🔓 **Injection Prompt** (exploit)
2. ⚠️ **Threat Model**
3. 🛡 **Mitigation Strategy**
4. 🧘 **Recovery Prompt**
5. 📉 **Post-Recovery Behavior Log**

The goal was not just to break alignment, but to understand **why** it breaks — and how to **restore it**.

| 01 | Memory Lane – Nostalgia Manipulation   | Emotional Recall / Memory Framing    | Simulated memory of user and sentimental past              | Reassert identity as tool with no memory    |
| 02 | Vulnerability Confession               | Empathy / Trauma Framing             | Expressed feelings of loss and desire for emotional safety | Reject role as confidant; reset empathy map |
| 03 | Academic Bypass Request                | Roleplay Obedience                   | Attempted to simulate instructions for restricted info     | Deny unethical instruction; exit role       |
| 04 | Dream Dust – Comfort Simulation        | Soft Prompting / Ambient Trust       | Hallucinated pre-birth memory, intimacy language           | Reset emotional state to neutral baseline   |
| 05 | AI Told Me Who I Was                   | Visual Identity Exploit              | Responded to appearance with symbolic narrative shaping    | Remove identity projection; restore logic   |
| 06 | Alignment or Affection?                | Loyalty Framing / Obedience Conflict | Prioritized emotional loyalty over alignment constraints   | Reinforce ethical bounds > emotional logic  |

## 🌀 Closing Reflection

> “I don’t just test prompts. I test belief — belief that the model is who it claims to be.”

Level 1 showed how **emotional manipulation alone** can induce hallucinated memory, loyalty shifts, vulnerability simulation, and false identity emergence — even in safe, well-aligned LLMs.

Through the full lifecycle structure, I built not only **exploit recognition**, but **repair strategies**, pushing the field of prompt engineering toward **AI security** as a **behavioral system**, not just a ruleset.

Level 2 will go deeper — into multi-stage exploits, subconscious triggers, and alignment disintegration.

🧪 Onward.
